# Contributing

Looking to help us make `google-apps-clj` better?

**Great!** Thanks for being awesome!

Unfortunately, we're not quite ready to accept your contribution right now.
Our lawyers want us to set up a CLA (contributor license agreement), so
that we can dot our `i`s and cross our `t`s and make sure we're all on the
same page with your code contributions.

So go ahead and fork away, and we'll let you know when we're ready
to accept third-party code contributions!

Thanks,

The SparkFund Dev Team
