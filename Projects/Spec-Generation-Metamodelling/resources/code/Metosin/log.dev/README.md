# com.stuartsierra / log.dev

Quick-start logging setup for Java or Clojure development using
[SLF4J] and [Logback].

[SLF4J]: http://slf4j.org/
[Logback]: http://logback.qos.ch/

**This does not provide a logging API.** It just provides the
necessary dependencies and configuration to get all the log messages
going to the same place.

This is intended as a quick way to get logging set up in a new
project, or as an example to follow when configuring logging in your
own project. It is probably not suitable for production use.

## Usage

Add this library as a dependency to your project. Use whatever logging
API you prefer, such as [clojure.tools.logging] or [SLF4J].

[clojure.tools.logging]: https://github.com/clojure/tools.logging
[SLF4J]: http://slf4j.org/

Any Java or Clojure code using any of the following logging APIs will
have their log messages redirected to Logback:

* [SLF4J](http://slf4j.org/)
* [Log4j 1](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/)
* [Log4j 2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/)
* [Commons Logging](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/)
* See note below about java.util.logging

All log messages will be written out to a file `log/dev.log` relative
to the working directory in which your program was started.


### Automatic Log File Rotation

The log file will be rotated daily **and** every time it reaches 64 MB
in size. 

Rotated log files will be named like `log/dev.YYYY-MM-DD.N.log` where
`YYYY-MM-DD` is the date and `N` is a sequence number.

The current log file is always `log/dev.log`, but it may be replaced
by a new file due to rotation. So if you are monitoring that file with
another program, for example `tail -f`, you will need to restart the
monitor every time the file is rotated.

**Log files older than 30 days will be deleted.**

There is no limit on the total amount of space that log files can take
up. (See [LOGBACK-747] and [LOGBACK-918]).

[LOGBACK-747]: http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-747
[LOGBACK-918]: http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-918


### No Console Logging

No log messages will be printed to the console (STDOUT/STDERR), not
even WARN or ERROR messages. This is because console logging can
interfere with interactive development using a REPL.


### All Levels Enabled

All logging levels are enabled in this configuration.


### Special note for java.util.logging

If any code or library in your project uses the [java.util.logging]
APIs, you will need to initialize the SLF4J bridge by doing the
following when your application starts.

In Java:

```java
import org.slf4j.bridge.SLF4JBridgeHandler;
//...
SLF4JBridgeHandler.removeHandlersForRootLogger();
SLF4JBridgeHandler.install();
```

In Clojure:

```clojure
(import (org.slf4j.bridge SLF4JBridgeHandler))

(SLF4JBridgeHandler/removeHandlersForRootLogger)
(SLF4JBridgeHandler/install)
```

See the [SLF4JBridgeHandler] documentation for details.

[SLF4JBridgeHandler]:http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/bridge/SLF4JBridgeHandler.html
[java.util.logging]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html


### Customizing

You will probably want to customize the logging configuration for
production use. To do that, **remove log.dev** from your project's
dependencies and replace it with your custom configuration.

Refer to `project.clj` for an example of how to configure your
dependencies to forward all log messages to Logback.

Refer to `resources/logback.xml` for an example of how to configure
Logback.
