# sieppari [![cljdoc badge](https://cljdoc.org/badge/metosin/sieppari)](https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/sieppari/CURRENT)


Small, fast, and complete interceptor library for Clojure/Script with built-in support
for common async libraries.

> Noun
> **Siepata (Intercept)**

>   sieppari, _someone or something that intercepts_

## What it does

Interceptors, like in [Pedestal](http://pedestal.io/reference/interceptors), but
with minimal implementation and optimal performance.

The core _Sieppari_ depends on Clojure and nothing else.

If you are new to interceptors, check the
[Pedestal Interceptors documentation](http://pedestal.io/reference/interceptors).
Sieppari's `sieppari.core/execute` follows a `:request` / `:response` pattern. For
Pedestal-like behavior, use `sieppari.core/execute-context`.

## First example

```clj
(ns example.simple
  (:require [sieppari.core :as s]))

;; interceptor, in enter update value in `[:request :x]` with `inc`
(def inc-x-interceptor
  {:enter (fn [ctx] (update-in ctx [:request :x] inc))})

;; handler, take `:x` from request, apply `inc`, and return an map with `:y`
(defn handler [request]
  {:y (inc (:x request))})

(s/execute
  [inc-x-interceptor handler]
  {:x 40})
;=> {:y 42}
```

## Async

Any step in the execution pipeline (`:enter`, `:leave`, `:error`) can return either a context map (synchronous execution) or an instance of [`AsyncContext`](https://github.com/metosin/sieppari/blob/develop/src/sieppari/async.cljc) - indicating asynchronous execution.

By default, clojure deferrables, `java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage` and `js/promise` satisfy the `AsyncContext` protocol.

Using `s/execute` with async steps will block:

```clj
;; async interceptor, in enter double value of `[:response :y]`:
(def multiply-y-interceptor
  {:leave (fn [ctx]
            (future
              (Thread/sleep 1000)
              (update-in ctx [:response :y] * 2)))})


(s/execute
  [inc-x-interceptor multiply-y-interceptor handler]
  {:x 40})
; ... 1 second later:
;=> {:y 84}
```

Using non-blocking version of `s/execute`:

```clj
(s/execute
  [inc-x-interceptor multiply-y-interceptor handler]
  {:x 40}
  (partial println "SUCCESS:")
  (partial println "FAILURE:"))
; => nil
; prints "SUCCESS: {:y 84}" 1sec later
```

Blocking on async computation:

```clj
(let [respond (promise)
      raise (promise)]
  (s/execute
    [inc-x-interceptor multiply-y-interceptor handler]
    {:x 40}
    respond
    raise) ; returns nil immediately

  (deref respond 2000 :timeout))
; ... 1 second later:
;=> {:y 84}
```

Any step can return a `java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage` or `js/promise`, Sieppari works oob with libraries like [Promesa](http://funcool.github.io/promesa/latest):

```clj
;; [funcool/promesa "5.1.0"]`
(require '[promesa.core :as p])

(def chain
  [{:enter #(update-in % [:request :x] inc)}               ;; 1
   {:leave #(p/promise (update-in % [:response :x] / 10))} ;; 4
   {:enter #(p/delay 1000 %)}                              ;; 2
   identity])                                              ;; 3

;; blocking
(s/execute chain {:x 40})
; => {:x 41/10} after after 1sec

;; non-blocking
(s/execute
  chain
  {:x 40}
  (partial println "SUCCESS:")
  (partial println "SUCCESS:"))
; => nil
;; prints "SUCCESS: {:x 41/10}" after 1sec
```

## External Async Libraries

To add a support for one of the supported external async libraries, just add a dependency to them and `require` the
respective Sieppari namespace. Currently supported async libraries are:

* [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) - `sieppari.async.core-async`, clj & cljs
* [Manifold](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold) - `sieppari.async.manifold` clj

To extend Sieppari async support to other libraries, just extend the `AsyncContext` protocol.

## core.async

Requires dependency to `[org.clojure/core.async "0.4.474"]` or higher.

```clj
(require '[clojure.core.async :as a])

(defn multiply-x-interceptor [n]
  {:enter (fn [ctx]
            (a/go (update-in ctx [:request :x] * n)))})

(s/execute
  [inc-x-interceptor (multiply-x-interceptor 10) handler]
  {:x 40})
;=> {:y 411}
```

## manifold

Requires dependency to `[manifold "0.1.8"]` or higher.

```clj
(require '[manifold.deferred :as d])

(defn minus-x-interceptor [n]
  {:enter (fn [ctx]
            (d/success-deferred (update-in ctx [:request :x] - n)))})

(s/execute
  [inc-x-interceptor (minus-x-interceptor 10) handler]
  {:x 40})
;=> {:y 31}
```

# Performance

_Sieppari_ aims for minimal functionality and can therefore be
quite fast. Complete example to test performance is
[included](https://github.com/metosin/sieppari/blob/develop/examples/example/perf_testing.clj).

## Silly numbers

Executing a chain of 10 interceptors, which have `:enter` of `clojure.core/identity`.

* **sync**: all steps return the ctx
* **promesa**: all steps return the ctx in an `promesa.core/promise`
* **core.async**: all step return the ctx in a `core.async` channel
* **manifold**: all step return the ctx in a `manifold.deferred.Deferred`

All numbers are execution time lower quantile (not testing the goodness of the async libraries
, just the execution overhead sippari interceptors adds)

| Executor          | sync   | promesa | core.async | manifold |
| ----------------- | -------|---------|------------|----------|
| Pedestal          | 8.2µs  |  -      | 92µs       | -        |
| Sieppari          | 1.2µs  |  4.0µs  | 70µs       | 110µs    |
| Middleware (comp) | 0.1µs  |  -      | -          | -        |

* MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 MB RAM
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_151-b12)
* Clojure 1.9.0

**NOTE**: running async flows without interceptors is still much faster,
e.g. synchronous `manifold` chain is much faster than via interceptors.

**NOTE**: Goal is to have a Java-backed and optimized chain compiler into Sieppari,
initial tests show it will be near the perf of middleware chain / `comp`.

# Differences to Pedestal

## Execution

* `io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/execute` executes _Contexts_
* `sieppari.core/execute` executes _Requests_ (which are internally wrapped inside a _Context_ for interceptors)

## Errors

* In _Pedestal_ the `error` handler takes two arguments, the `ctx` and the exception.
* In _Sieppari_ the `error` handlers takes just one argument, the `ctx`, and the exception is in the `ctx` under the key `:error`.
* In _Pedestal_ the `error` handler resolves the exception by returning the `ctx`, and continues the **error** stage by re-throwing the exception.
* In _Sieppari_ the `error` handler resolves the exception by returning the `ctx` with the `:error` removed. To continue in the **error**  stage, just return the `ctx` with the exception still at `:error`.
*  In _Pedestal_ the exception are wrapped in other exceptions.
* In _Sieppari_ exceptions are not wrapped.
* _Pedestal_ interception execution catches `java.lang.Throwable` for error processing. _Sieppari_ catches `java.lang.Exception`. This means that things like out of memory or class loader failures are not captured by _Sieppari_.

## Async

* _Pedestal_ transfers thread local bindings from call-site into async interceptors.
* _Sieppari_ does not support this.
