This is a small project to capture the code as I move through the 
Lacinia tutorial and, add some authorization functionality to it.


The tutorial is available at: https://lacinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html

I love this line from the tutorials introduction: 
Along the way, we hope youâ€™ll learn quite a bit about not just Lacinia and GraphQL, **but about building Clojure applications in general**.
