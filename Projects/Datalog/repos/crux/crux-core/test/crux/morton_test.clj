;; TODO: the x and y axis encoding has gone confused again, this is
;; not necessarily a big issue, but it will confuse when comparing
;; with various other resources. Most examples assume y dimension is
;; before x, but our code has been aiming to not do this. But this is
;; a bit misguided, as one can separate encoding from which value one
;; puts on which dimension, so plan to fix this.
